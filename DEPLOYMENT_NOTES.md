# Deployment Notes

This document contains important information about the ClientView deployment optimization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Redundant Files
- Deleted all duplicate documentation files (START_HERE.md, PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md, QUICKSTART.md, etc.)
- Kept only README.md with essential information
- Removed python-backend folder (not fully implemented and not needed for basic deployment)

### 2. Vercel Configuration
- Created `vercel.json` with optimal settings for Next.js deployment
- Configured API routes with 30-second max duration
- Set up proper regions for deployment

### 3. Color Scheme Update
- Changed from blue/indigo/purple to green color scheme throughout the app
- Updated all primary colors to use green-600 and green-700
- Updated accent colors to use emerald and teal tones
- Maintained red for destructive actions and errors

### 4. Dependency Cleanup
- Removed unused dependencies:
  - `zustand` (state management - not implemented)
  - `@dnd-kit/core`, `@dnd-kit/sortable`, `@dnd-kit/utilities` (drag-and-drop - not implemented)
- Kept essential dependencies for current functionality

### 5. ESLint Configuration
- Simplified .eslintrc.json to avoid version conflicts
- Focused on Next.js core web vitals

### 6. Environment Variables
The following environment variables are needed:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_your-token-here
```

Create these in the Vercel dashboard under your project settings.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Optimize for Vercel deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Add environment variables
   - Deploy

3. **Set up Vercel Blob Storage**
   - In Vercel dashboard, go to Storage tab
   - Create a new Blob store
   - Copy the token to environment variables

## Features

- ✅ Upload PowerPoint presentations
- ✅ AI-powered analysis (demo with mock data)
- ✅ Template library with filtering
- ✅ Visual builder interface
- ✅ AI editing panel (ready for Claude API integration)

## Current Status

- **Frontend**: 100% complete and optimized for Vercel
- **Mock Data**: Fully functional demo mode
- **AI Integration**: Ready for API keys (Claude Sonnet 4)
- **File Storage**: Ready for Vercel Blob integration

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to add full functionality:

1. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to enable real AI editing
2. Add `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` to enable file uploads
3. Implement actual PowerPoint processing (future enhancement)
4. Add database for template persistence (future enhancement)

## Notes

- The app currently works in demo mode with mock data
- No backend required for basic functionality
- All API routes are serverless functions on Vercel
- Green color scheme applied consistently across all pages
- Simplified user interface with clean, modern design
